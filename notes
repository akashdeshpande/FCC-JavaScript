In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons. Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.
= is known as the assignment operator

When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".

In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. 

% is known as the remainder operator

var myName = "your name"; "your name" is called a string literal. 

Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	word boundary
\f	form feed

.length is used to calculate string length

In JS strings are immutable, which means individual characters of a string cannot be changed once created.
This does not mean that Strings cannot hange over time, just that individual characters of a string cannot be changed.

Unlike Strings, arrays are mutable

.push() pushes element ot the end of the array
.pop() pops the element at the end of the array. pop() returns the popped element, we can store this element into a new var
